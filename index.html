    <p>Hello. My name is Nicole Rosenberg, and this is my Slack code challenge
      submission.</p>
    <h3 class="v-text-2 u-margin-top-2">The challenge</h3>
    <p>The description of the challenge, as I received it, is as follows:</p>
    <blockquote class="v-font-italics u-margin-left-half">
      <p>This exercise is meant to demonstrate:</p>
      <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
        <li>The ability to access to a public API and successfully retrieve data
          from it;</li>
        <li>The ability to display that data on a page using only native
          JavaScript (no libraries); and</li>
        <li>The ability to update the UI of a page without refreshing the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'd like you to create a web page that shows a photo in a lightbox
        view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display
        the photo title.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Cool.</p>

    <h3 class="v-text-2 u-margin-top-2">My approach</h3>
    <p>
      I like having a lot of visibility into
      the full feature development lifecycle, because I can be a better engineer
      when I understand the fundamental goals of a feature.
    </p>

    <p>
      To that end, I decided to create some context for the development of a
      feature that would require a lightbox. I used myself and my weirdo friends
      as a proxy for the user population of Slack because a) we actually use the
      product regularly, b) I have insight into our needs as users, and c) it’s
      my challenge and I can do what I want.
    </p>

    <p>So here’s the use case:</p>

    <blockquote class="v-font-italics u-margin-left-half">
      <p>
        Slack users (i.e. Nicole et al.) have developed a very visual
        conversational style. As lovers of reaction gifs and infographics, their
        Slack channels are full of each.
      </p>

      <p>
        These users are HipChat refugees, a land where there was no Giphy
        integration, and as such most individuals have come to rely on reaction
        gifs pulled from across the web. These images are often shared as links,
        but they will occasionally upload images as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users have expressed a desire for an easy way to browse all images (but
        just images) shared to a channel. They also need a way to download/get a
        link to individual images so that they can reuse/share them.
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The feature should allow users to quickly scan shared images and then get
      at their source.
    </p>
    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">My solution</p>
    <p>
      My solution is to create a new section in the channel
      details that collects uploaded/linked-to images and displays their
      thumbnails. Clicking on a thumbnail spawns a lightbox which shows the
      image and provides a 'link out to' and, if supported, a 'download' action.
    </p>

    <p>
      I dummied up a Slack interface (it's not 100% accurate, but hopefully
      gives you a good enough idea), and added the new feature section. If
      you're eager to just see it already, you can
      <a href="challenge.html">go to the challenge demo page</a>. But you've
      come this far, might as well keep reading.

    </p>

    <h3 class="v-text-2 u-margin-top-2">A note about the CSS</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to use an atomic/functional approach to the styles, because:
    </p>
    <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
      <li>
        it's easier to make small changes to visual components without
        fighting inheritance and specificity
      </li>
      <li>it can help keep overall stylesheet file size down</li>
      <li>it can help enforce design consistency throughout an app</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Anyone seeing the proliferation of classes that comes with a functional
      CSS approach for the first time is at an increased risk of table-flipping
      and hair-rending. I’m not indifferent to the fact that the markup starts
      to look a little nutso, but the performance benefits of smaller
      stylesheets vastly outweigh any hits taken from verbose HTML.
    </p>

    <h3 class="v-text-2 u-margin-top-2">
      Next Steps (a.k.a. How to evolve the feature, a.k.a Stuff I didn't do)
    </h3>

    <p>
      Currently this feature is very much in a proof-of-concept state. The
      following are next steps to get this to MVP.
    </p>

    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">Make the lightbox responsive</p>
    <p>
      The current implementation does not respond to window resize. At a
      minimum, the overlay should resize with window resize, but really both
      the overlay and images should resize. Ideally, the buttons would also
      shrink below a certain breakpoint.
    </p>

    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">
      Make the lightbox module more reusable
    </p>

    <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
      <li>
        Allow developers to customize the lightbox actions (instead of
        automatically appending the download/link actions)
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow for multiple but distinct galleries to be instantiated on a single
        page
      </li>
      <li>Add customizable options</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">Improve the UI</p>
    <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
      <li>
        Build out a 'more images' experience. A good approach would be to use
        a similar pattern as the current 'Shared Files' feature in Slack. At
        a certain number of thumbnails, a 'View all images' link would be
        provided. That link would take users to a paginated image list
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop a better icon strategy. Right now, for time, I'm just using
        FontAwesome.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve support for the download feature. Only Chrome currently allows
        downloads from other origins, but you could build in a way to test if
        a link is from the same origin and then display the download link in
        Firefox.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">
      Optimize the page for perceived load time
    </p>
    <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
      <li>JS and CSS files should be minified and concatenated</li>
      <li>Resources should be gzipped or otherwise compressed</li>
      <li>Leverage some critical CSS</li>
      <li>
        Thumbnails could be optimized; maybe programmatically create smaller
        versions to decrease load time?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="v-text-4 v-fontweight-bold">Improve the build process</p>
    <ul class="u-margin-left-1">
      <li>
        Use a css pre/post-processor (preferably homegrown). At a minimum, it's
        faster and safer to store things like colors in variables that get
        re-used across the CSS.
      </li>
      <li>Use templating for the markup</li>
      <li>Leverage build tools</li>
    </ul>
